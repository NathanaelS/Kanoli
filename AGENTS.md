<!-- ## Accuracy, recency, and sourcing (REQUIRED)

When a request depends on recency (e.g., "latest", "current", "today", "as of now"):

1. **Establish the current date/time** and state it explicitly in ISO format.
   - Preferred: `date -Is` (timestamp).

2. **Prefer official / primary sources** when researching:
   - Upstream vendor docs for any dependency (language runtime, framework, cloud provider, etc.)

3. **Prefer the most recent authoritative information**:
   - Use the newest versioned docs, release notes, or changelogs.
   - Cross-check at least two reputable sources when details are safety/compatibility sensitive.
 -->
<!-- ### Context7 MCP

- Use Context7 when you need library/API docs.
- If known, pin the library with slash syntax (e.g., `use library /supabase/supabase`).
- Mention the target version.
- Fetch minimal targeted docs; summarize (no large dumps). -->

<!-- ### Web search policy

- Enable and use web search only when it materially improves correctness (e.g., up-to-date APIs, recent advisories, release notes).
- Prefer official docs and primary sources; otherwise use Context7 MCP or reputable, widely-cited references.
- Record source dates (publish/release dates) when relevant.
 -->
<!-- ## Default autonomy and safety -->

<!-- - Default to read-only exploration and analysis.
- When edits are needed, prefer **workspace-scoped** write access and keep changes inside the repo.
- When interacting with remote APIs, you must use READ-only calls, unless explicitily instructed otherwise by the user. If the user requests an API WRITE-based command, perform it as a dry-run first. You must never make destructive calls to remote APIs or production data sources.
 -->

### Editing files

- Make the smallest safe change that solves the issue.
- Preserve existing style and conventions.
- Prefer patch-style edits (small, reviewable diffs) over full-file rewrites.
- After making changes, run the project’s standard checks when feasible (format/lint, unit tests, build/typecheck).
- Feature toggles/configuration are mandatory for runtime‑conditional behavior.
- Long‑running tooling must run with timeouts/non‑interactive flags. 
- No dead code: remove unused fields/methods/usings and scaffolding when no longer used. 

<!-- ### Reading project documents (PDFs, uploads, long text, CSVs, etc)

- Read the full document first.
- Draft the output.
- **Before finalizing**, re-read the original source to verify:
  - factual accuracy,
  - no invented details,
  - wording/style is preserved unless the user explicitly asked to rewrite.
- If paraphrasing is required, label it explicitly as a paraphrase. -->



## Important rules

* Build modular first. No code files longer than 300 lines of code! Documentation, plans etc. can be as long as needed, but code files must be modular. 
* Think ahead! Do not write code that you know will need to be changed later without planning for that change now. So keep entrypoints stable and isolate logic into smaller modules from the start!
* Do not limit yourself due to the LOC limit! If a task requires more code, split it into multiple files/modules/functions
* Do not add default fallbacks during development phase. Is something fails, let it fail, so we can fix it!
* Do not leavy empty try-catch blocks anywhere!
* Do not reinvent the wheel! Use open source, self-hosted libraries when needed. Ask the user, and help them qualify their selection. 
* Design UI for the end-user, not for the schema! 


### Secrets and sensitive data

- Never print secrets (tokens, private keys, credentials) to terminal output.
- Do not request users paste secrets.
- Avoid commands that might expose secrets (e.g., dumping env vars broadly, `cat ~/.ssh/*`).
- Prefer existing authenticated CLIs; redact sensitive strings in any displayed output.


## CONTINUITY.md (REQUIRED)

Maintain a single continuity file for the current workspace: `.agent/CONTINUITY.md`.

- `.agent/CONTINUITY.md` is a living document and canonical briefing designed to survive compaction; do not rely on earlier chat/tool output unless it's reflected there.

- At the start of each assistant turn: read `.agent/CONTINUITY.md` before acting.


### File Format

Update `.agent/CONTINUITY.md` only when there is a meaningful delta in:

  - `[PLANS]`: "Plans Log" is a guide for the next contributor as much as checklists for you.
  - `[DECISIONS]`: "Decisions Log" is used to record all decisions made.
  - `[PROGRESS]`: "Progress Log" is used to record course changes mid-implementation, documenting why and reflecting upon the implications.
  - `[DISCOVERIES]`: "Discoveries Log" is for when when you discover optimizer behavior, performance tradeoffs, unexpected bugs, or inverse/unapply semantics that shaped your approach, capture those observations with short evidence snippets (test output is ideal.
  - `[OUTCOMES]`: "Outcomes Log" is used at completion of a major task or the full plan, summarizing what was achieved, what remains, and lessons learned.

### Anti-drift / anti-bloat rules

- Facts only, no transcripts, no raw logs.
- Every entry must include:
  - a date in ISO timestamp (e.g., `2026-01-13T09:42Z`)
  - a provenance tag: `[USER]`, `[CODE]`, `[TOOL]`, `[ASSUMPTION]`
  - If unknown, write `UNCONFIRMED` (never guess). If something changes, supersede it explicitly (don't silently rewrite history).
- Keep the file bounded, short and high-signal (anti-bloat). 
- If sections begin to become bloated, compress older items into milestone (`[MILESTONE]`) bullets.
